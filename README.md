# Game-Of-Life



An implementation of Conway's Game of Life done in C++ .This took a while to code because as can be seen from the .cpp file it includes a lot of if statements. Since i am currently reading about parallel programming, i plan on changing the .cpp by using the thread library and the mutex library.
