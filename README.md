# Game-Of-Life



An implementation of Conway's Game of Life done in C++ .This took a while to code because as can be seen from the .cpp file it includes a lot of if statements. Since i am currently reading about parallel programming, i plan on changing the .cpp by using the thread library and the mutex library. 

<b> Please keep in mind i have purposely made the app run into an infinite loop to look at changes in live-dead cells. 
  You can get out of the infinite loop by clickign CTRL+C or CTRL+D in your text editor. </b>
